# 🎅🏻🌟🎄 Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in Rust 🦀.

From [AoC's](https://adventofcode.com/2022) about page:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## How to run

To run the solution for a given day, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin dayN
```

where `N` is the day number.

To run tests for a given day, run the following command:

```bash
cargo test --bin dayN
```

where `N` is the day number.
